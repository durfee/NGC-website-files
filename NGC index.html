			<h3>IRSA</h3>
			<p>The <em>International Relations Students Association</em> (<em>IRSA</em>) was established thirty years ago in 1983 and has always been recognized as one of the most highly regarded student organizations not only on the UBC campus but also across the country. Our formal mission is to provide a forum for international discourse and an outlet for students with an academic focus, or even simply a personal interest, in international affairs. What IRSA also provides is a meaningful focal point for networking, which we as students are learning is extremely important in the steps we take to finish off our University degrees and enter the “real world.” At each of our events throughout the year our goal is for students to meet a broad range of academics and professionals who work in the field of international affairs both here in Vancouver and in other parts of the world. </p>

			<h3>ISSA</h3>
			<p>The <em>International Studies Student Association</em> (<em>ISSA</em>) is the departmental student union for the School for International Studies at Simon Fraser University. We are elected representatives to advocate for the concerns and intersts of International Studies (IS) students. All undergraduate students currently taking at least one IS course are considered members of the Association, as are all students declared in its major, minor, and honours programmes. The goal of the ISSA is to work with both the International Studies department and the Simon Fraser Student Society (SFSS) in order to make students’ time at Simon Fraser as rewarding as possible. As well, we plan social and educational events for IS students, faculty and staff and sit on Department and SFSS committees. Events in the past have included dinners, keynotes, movie nights, career fairs and faculty meet-and-greets.</p>
